    This is a simple html file which helps user to take notes while listening to 
    youtube video without any distraction and hassle free switching between 
    youtube video and notepad/onenotes apps etc.

    Why this Page ?
    * It helps to take notes for video within same page using textarea and copy 
    the notes from textarea once done with the video.
    * To make the things simple whenever user clicks the textarea the video will 
    get paused, so that user can pour is information on notes and clicking the 
    video again will start playing the video. 

    Notes: Since i am a novice UI developer i may mixed the frames, actions players etc, 
    but the main intention i want to get here is to have simple page to play video and 
    take notes and hope it will be useful for school kids, all engg, academics etc. 
    So please bear with me on my code.
    Anyone can freely improve the script so that we all can benefit from it :)

    Thanks: To everyone providing details in stackoverflow and and many other open source 
    sites from which i used to study/utilize some JS codes to build this small utility.

    Dedicated To: This utility is dedicated to all open source community, wikipedia etc for
    their dedication to help all.
